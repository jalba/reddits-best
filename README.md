# Reddit's best

This small app, created with [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) renders the ten best posts from Reddit, according to their [public api](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/#GET_best).
By clicking on the subreddit titles you can get more information about that particular subreddit.
I mostly built this app for learning purposes. I wanted to try and use [redux-actions](https://redux-actions.js.org/) and [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/). And also to gain some familiarity with Netifly.
You can check the application deployed in Netifly here: https://reddits-best.netlify.com/

To run it locally, you first need to install it's dependencies via `npm install` or `yarn install` and then you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
